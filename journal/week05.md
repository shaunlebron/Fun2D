# Teaching Week 5

_October 24, 2010_

This week, I caught everyone up (at least everyone who had a computer). Every
student drew a background and a player. Every student wrote code to display
their background and player. Every student figured out how to position the
player on the screen. Every student has a working game.

I was able to command their attention by giving them simple steps to fill out a
code template on their worksheet. I gave them time constraints for each step,
and went around teaching them how to use MSPaint to create and size their
backgrounds. They learned that the light gray color is the color that is erased
when displaying it in the game to allow their player to blend in with the
background.
