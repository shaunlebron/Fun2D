# Teaching Week 7

_November 9, 2010_

I forgot to write an entry last week. I sat down with the students and made sure all of them, at least 6 of them, had a working game with arrow keys moving their player around. I made the decision to not try to catch up the students who were falling behind, because the whole class is running out of time. I want to make sure the students who were paying attention get their games done by week 10.

I started the class by reviewing how to setup conditions, and making sure they understood why this simple bit of code works:

```
if key(“right”) then
	player.x = player.x + 10
end
```

I had some students go to the board to write down solutions to questions I asked them (e.g. how do you make the player go down 10 pixels if I press the “Q” key?). When I was satisfied that some of the students understood it, I marched them to the lab and most of them finished, while I spent, yet again, the majority of the class catching up students, racing around trying to help as many as I could. One student called me to his desk and pointed to his screen with illegible code in all caps and told me he didn’t know what to do. I basically told him I couldn’t help him because it would take me too long to bring him up to speed. I didn’t have a choice.

Another side effect of trying to catch up the other students is that the good students have so much free time, so they start playing online games.
