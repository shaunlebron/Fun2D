# Teaching Week 4

_October 18, 2010_

I prepared a shorter worksheet than last week’s. It had a brief review of how
to create and use images, and some definitions for functions, scenes, and
pixels.

The bulk of the review was focused on how to create, load, display, and move
the images in their game. Classroom management was very difficult this time. I
tried going around to each table after talking to the whole class about a page.

After we reached a stopping point for the worksheet, we went to the lab. I gave
them a sheet with lines of code with areas to fill in based on their
understanding. I didn’t explain what the sheet was, but I went around the room
to each student after failing to use a roll of paper as a megaphone to get
their attention. I got some stares from the students after my ridiculous
attempt to get their attention, but they just went right back to talking. The
rest of the class was hectic, and many didn’t finish their program. A few
students got done, but most didn’t.
