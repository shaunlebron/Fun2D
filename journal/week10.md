# Teaching Week 10 and presentation

_December 2, 2010_

Yesterday was the final session. At the start of the class, I immediately took
the six chosen students to the lab, leaving the other students behind with the
team leader.

The team leader had prepared scripts for them based on some key facts and
subjects that I outlined. They had all memorized their lines. One of the lead
citizen schools teachers came in and prepared them for the next dayâ€™s
presentation at nasa. They practiced their lines, introducing themselves and
their games, and saying three things that they learned.

The rest of the class was devoted to finishing their games. All of them were
completed by the end of the class. One student made a two-player game. Another
added multiple missiles with varying speeds. Another added their own jump
button before I could even help them out.

Today was the presentation. They all read their lines, and improvised very well
in front of the audience. Each of them played their game in front of the
audience, drawing some laughs and of course applause. I bragged on them, how
they wrote actual code to make their game work. They even gave me a citizen
schools coffee receptacle at the end as a thank you.

We then proceeded to take a tour of nasa. Many of them were fascinated by the
simulators, mockups, and rockets that they saw. I think it has been a pretty
successful teaching program. The last thing left to do are the two showcases in
the following weeks.
